#### The task:

The catalog is filled by the Administrator by adding and modifying / deleting them. Each book must have an address (place on the shelf) or a reader. The reader, in order to take the book, registers, leaving the e-mail and telephone number. The book can be taken from the Administrator in the library for a period of no more than a month,
only if the book is available in the library. The administrator must have a page where the books and readers who use the book are reflected.
